# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I took a methodical approach to identifying vulnerabilities and fixing them. When needed I communicated with the client proactively especially if they had existing issues in production.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Given the sample codebase was old, owasp dependency checks found a lot of issues.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Using more automated tools might help identify more problems and will help identify other layers that need increased security improvements.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I checked by rerunning security checks, manually verifying and reviewing code with peer developers. Our CI pipeline regularly reruns tests and flags new issues.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Automated tools that can be integrated into continuous development and deployment pipelines are great.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
The security report created will show employers that I am experienced in secure software development.
